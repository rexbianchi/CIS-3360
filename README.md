# CIS-3360
Programming assignments for my Security in Computing class I took in Spring 2021. They are both completed in the Python programming language and assume ASCII input.

## PA01 - Vigenère Cipher

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword (Wikipeida). It is quite trivial to break in today's era, however it is a good demonstration on the basics of encryption.

## PA02 - Checksums

A checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage (Wikipedia). This program generates checksums of either 8, 16, or 32-bit sizes.
